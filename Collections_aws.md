Ansible Collections are a way to package, distribute, and consume content, including playbooks, roles, modules, and plugins, in a structured and versioned format. Collections provide a modular and shareable way to organize and distribute Ansible content, making it easier to reuse and manage automation assets. Collections were introduced to Ansible to address the challenge of managing and sharing content in a more scalable and organized manner.
